# Hi, I'm Denghan Xiong 👋

I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at the ZJU-UIUC Institute.  
My work focuses on **robotics, control, and embodied AI**, especially integrating  
reinforcement learning with real-world robotic systems and bio-inspired sensors.

### 🔬 Research Interests
- Reinforcement Learning for robotic control  
- Dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand)  
- Nonholonomic robot navigation & cul-de-sac escape  
- Bio-inspired underwater whisker sensors  
- Embodied AI / humanoid robotics
