# Hi, I'm Denghan Xiong 👋

I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at ZJU-UIUC Institute.  
My work focuses on **robotics, control, and embodied AI**, especially integrating  
reinforcement learning with real-world robotic systems and bio-inspired sensors.

### 🔬 Research Interests
- Reinforcement Learning for robotic control  
- Dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand)  
- Nonholonomic robot navigation & cul-de-sac escape  
- Bio-inspired underwater whisker sensors  
- Embodied AI / humanoid robotics

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Programming:** Python, MATLAB, ROS/ROS2, MuJoCo, PyTorch  
- **Robotics:** RL control, state estimation, motion planning  
- **Hardware:** PDMS fabrication, flexible electronics, strain-gauge sensing  

### 📄 Selected Projects
- **RL-based Shadow Dexterous Hand Grasping** – PPO control for high-DoF manipulation  
- **Dead-End Escape via Deep RL** – Nonholonomic robot escaping narrow cul-de-sacs  
- **Bio-Inspired Whisker Sensor** – PDMS + silicon strain gauges for underwater flow sensing  
- **Offshore Wind Power Transmission Study** – Comparative review of HVDC/HVAC systems
